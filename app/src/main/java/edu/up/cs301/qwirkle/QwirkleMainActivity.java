/**
 * Class: QwirkleMainActivity
 * This class contains the code to interact with the QwirkleMainActivity XML.
 *
 * Status: We have one minor bug which is when you enter in a long name for one
 * of the players, each time it was their turn, the whole board was pushed down
 * to accommodate the whole name. We will work on setting up an if statement
 * which checks player name length and adjusts text size based on that length.
 *
 * The only other kind of critical bug we found was during network play,
 * when the network player tries to swap out all six of their tiles, when
 * they get new tiles, one tile is always blank. And when you click on that
 * blank spot, it selects a different tile in the player's hand. And vice
 * versa for the other tile. However, game play still works and you are able
 * to play the tiles in the hand. We are not sure why this is happening.
 * We have more debugging to do.
 *
 * Features added: night mode and message board at bottom of screen which
 * lets you know what actions players take
